### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I consider that the topics on the lab gave me the basics to understand some parts of the assignment but I still had to rely on the internet to some of the features such as the sidebar and more information about the useState and useEffect of React.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time I would commented my project to make it easier to read, as well as styling better the responsivity of the website to make it look better in mobile versions.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I would say that most of the project went well, there were some bugs when I tried to fetch from the API such as having to click twice the button of load more, and this had to do with the lifecycle of reactive effects. From my peers I did notice some really cool animations that I would like to try on another occasion.
